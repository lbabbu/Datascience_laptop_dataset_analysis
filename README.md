# Datascience_laptop_dataset_analysis
In this repository you can find a project in collaboration with Gabriele Dominelli.

This dataset on laptops and their technical specs was imported into this notebook from kaddle. 
There are 1302 rows in this dataset, and each one represents a separate laptop. 
On the other hand, each columnÂ represents a specification for a laptop. 
This dataset allows for a number of fascinating comparisons and analysis, some of which are presented here.
Among the most intriguing assessments are those on the most popular operating systems, laptop volume by category, 
laptop price distribution by CPU and GPU model, and price distribution by mounted operating system.
